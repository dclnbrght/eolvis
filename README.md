# eolvis
A simple web application to visualise software EOL (End-Of-Life) timelines.

The visualisation represents Supported From & To dates and planned Use From & To dates. These are displayed on a timeline to help with planning a technical roadmap.

NOTE: there is no database implementation yet, the web app reads in a JSON file, data can be edited in the app and the updated JSON file can be exported
