# eolvis
<em>eolvis</em> is a web application for visualising software EOL (End-Of-Life) timelines.

The visualisation represents Supported From & To dates and planned Use From & To dates. These are displayed on a timeline to help with planning a technical roadmap.

The UI is written in vanilla JavaScript, wrapped in an ASP.NET application. It can be hosted as an [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service) and uses [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/tables) as a data store.
